# Rust TDD Queue

Inspired by the recent presence of Uncle Bob at my workplace, I wanted to
practice TDD with a queue like data structure and use this as an opportunity to
also learn more Rust.

I've implemented an Iterator. Used the Option type. Used an array literal.
fail! macros, assertions etc.

I'd like to parameterize the size of the queue, but that does not yet appear to
be possible with Rust. The suggested solution is a macro.
